The nuxeo Connector for InDesign enables designers to import assets into an InDesign layout directly from nuxeo.
The connector is divided into 2 parts, a server side and a client side.

## QA

[![Build Status](https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=addons_nuxeo-indesign-connector-master)](https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/job/addons_nuxeo-indesign-connector-master/)

## Server side plugin

### How to install

Install the Marketplace package:

    nuxeoctl mp-install marketplace-nuxeo-indesign-connector/marketplace/target/marketplace-*.zip

## Client side Plugin

### How to install

#### Step 1

Copy the folder "`nuxeo-indesign-connector-client/package/org.nuxeo.indesignconnector`":
```
On Mac, into ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions
```
```
On Windows, into %APPDATA%\Adobe\CEP\extensions
```

#### Step 2

Mac OS X:

- Double click on the file **EnableUnsignedExtensions.command** that you will find under the "package/Scripts" folder.
- You will be asked to type your password, do so and press enter, that's it.

Windows:

- Open the registry key **HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.6** and add a key named PlayerDebugMode, of type String, and value 1.

#### Step 3

Restart inDesign and go to **Window > Extensions > nuxeo InDesign Connector**.
Once there click on the settings icon and fill in the following informations:
- URL of your nuxeo instance
- login
- password

If everything went well you should end up having a list of assets displayed.
Once there, if you want to add an asset into your inDesign document you just need to click on the thumbnail.

## Link persistency
Now, anytime your asset is modified within nuxeo you'll get a badge notification beside the reload icon. All you need to do is click on it and the new version of the asset will be imported.
You then need to display the links panel (**Window > links**) and double click on the alert icon to replace the old version by the new one.
